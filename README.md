## Patched culfw firmware for CUN/CUL devices<br>without rf duty cycle restrictions
This is version 1.6.7 of culfw without rf duty cycle restrictions.

### Compiling
This is ancient code to be compiled with just-as-ancient avr-gcc v4.8.1. <br>
It compiles perfectly using ancient Ubuntu 15.10 "Wily Werewolf".

### Disclaimer
This is an experimental firmware and it should only be used in a shielded laboratory from which no radio waves can escape. It should only ever be used for short-term testing purposes and should never be used in a productive environment. Using this firmware may result in regulatory violations.

### Thanks to others
- Thanking Rudolf Koenig for his [culfw](http://culfw.de/culfw.html) firmware with its latest version 1.6.7.
- Special thanks also goes to [Matthew Wire](https://www.mjwconsult.co.uk/en/), who [removed the duty cycle restrictions](https://blog.mjwconsult.co.uk/modifying-cul-firmware-to-increase-send-limit-for-eq3-max-heating-thermostats/) on [culfw version 1.6.6](https://github.com/mattwire/culfw).
